# npxl32-temporary
This was the placeholder for the [npxl32 website](https://www.npxl32.com/), but now it's just open source cuz why not.

You will need node.js LTS 20 to run this.
How to run:
```
git clone https://github.com/npxl32/npxl32-temporary.git
CD npxl32-temporary
npm install
npm start
```
Then it should be live at http://localhost:8080/

No other dependencies, just native node.js modules

Live:
[https://npxl32-temporary.azurewebsites.net/](https://npxl32-temporary.azurewebsites.net/)
(the temporary website uses azure free hosting tier while the real npxl32 website uses basic tier, so it could possibly be slow)
