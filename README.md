# npxl32-temporary
This was the placeholder for the [npxl32 website](https://www.npxl32.com/), but now it's just open source because it is extremely humorous (after all, the entire point of this website!)

You will need node.js LTS 20 to run this.
How to run:
```
git clone https://github.com/npxl32/npxl32-temporary.git
CD npxl32-temporary
npm install
npm start
```
Then it should be live at http://localhost:8080/

No other dependencies, just native node.js modules

(the live example uses free hosting tier so it could possibly be slow)
